# Palace Defender

'Palace Defender' is a low poly mobile tower defence game to demonstate my learning and skills within Unity and C#. This project also involved researching and considering video game marketing to then create a marketing plan for the game.

This project was completed in the first semester of my 'Games Development' module in the second year of my 'Computer Games Development' degree at Staffordshire University.

## Goals & Requirements
The goal for this assignment was to create and market a tower defence game demonstrate game development techniques including; input, menus, UI, collisions, particles, lighting, etc and their applications using C# and the Unity game engine as taught in the module.


## Project Thinking
As the project required everyone to develop a tower defence game I decided to use the Unity game engine as this is an engine I had previous experience with prior to university. I also decided to create a mobile game to have a unique product compared to others; using a low poly art style as this is one of my favourite art styles especially in mobile games.


## Key Learnings
This project allowed me to demonstrate my preexisting knowledge of Unity while also allowing me to explore the tower defence genre, mobile development as well as video game marketing and creating marketing plans.

- Mobile game development
- Taking a project through a full development cycle
- Understanding Video game marketing
- How to create an effective marketing plan for a video game

This project was an enjoyable experience allowing me to demonstrate my knowledge of Unity and C# as well as techniques learnt in this module and other modules while also allowing me to experiment with mobile game development.
